# JavaScript Week 2 - Calculator
## Instruction
- Toggle vision mode
    - User can toggle their preferred contrast mode (light or dark) using the top-left button

- To operate the calculator:
    - Users can use their keyboard keys to access buttons displayed on the screen
        - Note:
            - Clear: Shift + C
            - Backspace: Backspace
    - Users can click on the buttons via mouse cursor

## Additional Notes
- I have three branches: main, testing, and backup
    - Main contains the clean logical breakdown of my js code
    - Testing contains the rough draft of my js code, which also breakdown specific of what I tried and what didn't work, as I also documented reasons on why certain elements didn't work
    - Backup contains the first working prototype I based my project on, setting the basis of how I approached the logical framework of the js code

## Disclaimer
- The percentage and negative/positive buttons/key are currently not operational. I placed them there as placeholder to continue working on in the future
